Sent is a suckless utility that displays a text file
as a set of images into an X11 window.

While sent is good for presentations, some people may not be
able to do a full length presentation, because of time, being tired,
or other factors that may effect the quality of the presentation.

\Or simply for not having a good mic, like mine. :(

FFsentspeak provides a robotic way to convert sent
presentations to a simple "show and read text" video.

FFsentspeak is so small, it's less than
100 lines of POSIX shell code (including comments.)

FFsentspeak uses:
\- Sent & pdfimages to make the images.
#- Sent & pdf-images to make the images.
- Espeak to turn text into speach.
- FFmpeg to mix the images with the speech
  and turn them into a video.

FFsentspeak modifies the sent file format with the following modifications:
- Lines starting with a # wont be displayed.
- Lines starting with a \ and then a character that is not # or @ wont be read.
\- Lines starting with a double # (a ##) wont be displayed or read.
#- Lines starting with a double # (a ##) wont be displayed or red.
# You can use these new modifications to make espeak read text 
# without displaying it or to display text without making espeak reading it.
